## Description

This plugin uses **Three APIs** for its functionality:

1. **Steam Store API (Unofficial)**

   - This is the main API that provides detailed information about individual games.
   - It supports multiple languages (e.g., `en`, `hu`, etc.).

2. **Steam App List API** (Highly limited)

   - This API returns a list of all apps (games, software, and DLC) without any filtering options.
   - It's useful if you want to search for and select a specific game within the admin interface.
   - **Note:** This API is slow and has a **5-minute cache restriction**, which makes it less practical for frequent updates.

3. **Steam News API** (ISteamNews)
   - Get the news for the game (limited, and you cannot specify a language, it will use the default (English)).
   - You can use shortcode to display the news for a particular game, like a feed.
   - Has not saved any data to the database, the query is done with ajax.
   - You have to put the shortocde in the post template where you saved the games. The system will automatically identify which game news should be displayed.
   - **Shortcode: [steam_game_related_news feednumber="5" label="News"]**

## Plugin Behavior

- **No Duplicates:** The plugin ensures no duplicate posts are created when re-fetching game data.
- **Image Handling:**
  - The following images are saved in the WordPress Media Library:
    - Header Image (`header_image`)
    - Capsule Image (`capsule_image`)
    - Screenshots (`screenshots`)
  - **Inline images** from the full game description are handled as external resources and are not saved in the media library.
- **Full Game Description:**  
  If you use **Gutenberg**, the full game description is placed inside a **Classic Block**.  
  It's recommended to manually convert it to Gutenberg blocks (just one click).

- **Re-Fetching:**
  - Images (header, capsule, and screenshots) are not re-downloaded or duplicated when a game is re-fetched.
  - You can enable a setting to delete all related images from the media library when a game (post) is deleted.
